Welcome to my humble space
==========================

INSTALL
------
If you are using Chrome and Tampermonkey, you can simply click on a script, and select "Raw" to install it
If you are not, you will need to copy and paste the script into the greasemonkey (or equivalent) software

The first thing about this page is this page doesn't exist. :)

Second, feel free to fork this off and submit pull requests!

Third, all of these are at your risk. I use all the scripts on here, but YMMV

Fourth, I will support these scripts should there be any issues. Just email me

Fifth, these are developed and tested on Google Chrome. I do not have the time to test on FireFox or Safari. I will take bug reports, but issues on chrome will no doubt be fixed faster than any other browser.

Sixth, I do take suggestions, so please feel free to send me one 

Files

AutoLogins.user.js.js: Deprecated in favor of official integration with Ticket System

InTicketTweaks.user.js: This changes the colors inside the ticket

TicketTweaks.user.js: This does a mirad of things, but most importantly it makes it easy to see if a ticket needs attention

loginasclient.user.js: This is a goodie. This makes login as client actually work for our WHMCS url!
